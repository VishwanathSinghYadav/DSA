knightly number
A knight is on a chess board. Can you figure out the total number of ways the knight can move to a target position in exactly m moves? On a single move, the knight can move in an "L" shape; two spaces in any direction, then one space in a perpendicular direction. This means that on a single move, a knight has eight possible positions it can move to.

Write a function, knightlyNumber, that takes in 6 arguments:

n, m, kr, kc, pr, pc

n = the length of the chess board
m = the number of moves that must be used
kr = the starting row of the knight
kc = the starting column of the knight
pr = the target row
pc = the target column
The function should return the number of different ways the knight can move to the target in exactly m moves. The knight can revisit positions of the board if needed. The knight cannot move out-of-bounds of the board. You can assume that rows and columns are 0-indexed. This means that if n = 8, there are 8 rows and 8 columns numbered 0 to 7.

knightlyNumber(8, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5); // -> 2
knightlyNumber(8, 2, 7, 1, 7, 1); // -> 3
knightlyNumber(8, 2, 5, 4, 5, 4); // -> 8
knightlyNumber(8, 3, 5, 2, 4, 4); // -> 21
knightlyNumber(20, 6, 18, 7, 10, 15); // -> 60
knightlyNumber(20, 12, 8, 3, 9, 14); // -> 98410127
knightlyNumber(8, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1); // -> 0
