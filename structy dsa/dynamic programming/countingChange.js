counting change
Write a function, countingChange, that takes in an amount and an array of coins. The function should return the number of different ways it is possible to make change for the given amount using the coins.

You may reuse a coin as many times as necessary.

For example,

countingChange(4, [1,2,3]) -> 4

There are four different ways to make an amount of 4:

1. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
2. 1 + 1 + 2
3. 1 + 3
4. 2 + 2
countingChange(4, [1, 2, 3]); // -> 4
countingChange(8, [1, 2, 3]); // -> 10
countingChange(24, [5, 7, 3]); // -> 5
countingChange(13, [2, 6, 12, 10]); // -> 0
countingChange(512, [1, 5, 10, 25]); // -> 20119
countingChange(1000, [1, 5, 10, 25]); // -> 142511
countingChange(240, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]); // -> 1525987916

dynamic programming with memoization
const countingChange = (amount, coins, i = 0, memo = {}) => {
  const key = amount + ',' + i;
  if (key in memo) return memo[key];
  
  if (amount === 0) return 1;
  if (i === coins.length) return 0;
    
  const coin = coins[i];
  
  let count = 0;
  for (let qty = 0; (qty * coin) <= amount; qty += 1) {
    const remainder = amount - (coin * qty);
    count += countingChange(remainder, coins, i + 1, memo);
  }
  
  memo[key] = count;
  return count;
};
a = amount
c = # coins
